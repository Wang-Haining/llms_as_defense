Good morning, dear reader my friend.  Or at least pardon me because I'm going to pretend you're my friend.  That's because I think we *all* should be friends, by nature if not in a formal sense necessarily.  By which I mean we all should be looking out for everyone else's best interests at least, all the time.  The world would be a much happier place if we all would just learn to do that.  And it's a simple enough thing to do, in a way, too.  Just develop that attitude, and the way that should work out in practice will just naturally fall into place gradually.So.  What's new this morning?  I'm waiting to take some very highly blessed herbs this morning, which were given to me by a Tibetan lama with whom I'm beginning to study.  He's wonderful!  He's very practical and a brilliant teacher.  I only wish his English were slightly better, because it takes an effort to understand him sometimes, and I need his assistant to clarify points occasionally.  He knows about my pain problem and is working toward healing it, and I really believe that he has the ability at *least* to help very greatly with it.  I'm gonna *beat* this thing and have a *life* again.  That also is a vow.In other news, I just learned yesterday that a childhood friend of mine is also gay.  I'm arranging through a mutual friend to get in touch with him via email.  Oh, he's taken, it's nothing like that.  But I have very few gay friends, being so closeted and all, and I would *dearly* love to be back in touch with him and talk about stuff and hopefully develop a deep friendship with him.  I've missed him a lot over the years.  A lot.I should really come out some day.  Oh, I'm already out to a few friends, but that's all.  It's just that my life has in some respects been very lonely and unhappy here in the closet.  And I deserve better than this, much better indeed.  If nothing else, let this blog be an object lesson in the value of coming out of the closet whenever that's practical.  Don't try the way I've handled this at home because you'll probably make yourself deeply unhappy, as I did.Get yourself together, David.  Think of something more positive.  I know!  I'll go do my daily exercise (half an hour on a treadmill every day).  That should lift my spirits.  I'll be back, dear reader, hopefully with something more happy and useful to say.  L8r, peeps.                        well, i said i'd letcha know...  i didn't do any of that.  i fell asleep in my chair instead, hehe.  think i'll use the treadmill soon.  i'm gonna get myself into top shape, for health reasons and for the sake of my boyfriend-to-be, whoever he turns out to be.  i was very sedentary for a while there, what with the pain situation and all.  but since using the treadmill over the last few months the spare pounds (there weren't that many of them really either) have been dropping away at a good rapid but healthy pace and i'm feeling much stronger and better.  i do half an hour on the treadmill every day, pain permitting, which means six days a week or so on average so far, which is pretty good.  and i'm slowly increasing the difficulty.piece of advice:  if you've been sedentary for a while, and have use of a treadmill, do what i did.  i started with just five minutes at an easy difficulty level, and increased my time by thirty seconds per day until i reached half an hour.  i kept it *easy* all along the way, and that made a huge difference to my keeping it up.  because it was easy enough all along to feel good, it kept me inclined to do the exercise to begin with.  this is important.  exercise should be pleasant and fun.  if it's not, then maybe you're doing the wrong exercise or are pushing yourself too fast.i'm looking forward to starting to use the rowing machine we have buried somewhere.  i was a coxswain for freshman crew at harvard, so rowing is something i know and have good memories of.  plus it exercises more muscles than just the treadmill does.  i'm gonna get my whole body in top shape and the rowing machine should be fun to use.  once in college i did 150 miles at a stretch on a rowing machine.  impressed the hell out of my rowers.  i was just a little coxswain after all.i luv u, my readers my friends.  never forget that.  l8r...                        hey, peeps.  you know what, my dear reader my friend?  i love you.  that might sound corny and/or weird and/or unrealistic, but really properly analyzed it's not.  i love all living beings on general principles.  and i recommend that as a good way to be.  what does it mean that i love you, even not particularly knowing you well?  it means that i recognize you as a precious living being, deserving of happiness and its causes and deserving to overcome suffering completely.  it doesn't mean i know you personally and approve of your every characteristic.  i don't have to to love you as i do.  i wish you every happiness and no suffering at all.  a word of advice:  avoid malice like the plague.  i've decided that malice is the root cause of every suffering.  don't invest yourself in malice, even in subtle ways.  and don't fear malice.  by that i mean neither be afraid of (fear) malice nor obey (fear) malice.  and by malice i mean the wish and/or intention that someone suffer, in whatever way in whatever degree, be that yourself or someone else.  never punish yourself, cause that's a form of malice and you'll suffer for it.  and *noone* deserves to suffer.  dangerous people deserve to be quarantined so they don't harm people, but they don't deserve to be punished in the sense of being made to suffer.  imagine what the world would be like without any malice at all!  seriously, imagine it.  think about it.  invest your energy like that into making the world free from malice.  even those *thoughts* actually help, i promise!  thought power is a very real thing, and it has a greater effect upon oneself and others than most of us have been trained to imagine.  use it well.  use it joyfully to abandon malice in all of its forms.  i *promise* you you'll be making good karma that way and *will* be rewarded.  invest yourself well into the abandonment of malice and you'll be rewarded mightily.  this is no exaggeration.  the reward might take a while to reach you, but it *will* come.  this is a total promise.  we *can* eliminate malice, and we *will* eliminate malice.  this is a vow of mine as well as a promise.  so, dear reader dear friend, remember that i love you.  and write to me if you need a friend, 'cause i vow that i'll be as good a friend to you as circumstances make practical.  l8rz...                        hey, peeps, just added a new link!  *please*, every single day click on the link to The Hunger Site.  there, completely free of charge to you, you can click on a link which gives food to the hungry!  also there are tabs at the top of that page which take you to four other charity sites where you can do the same kind of thing!  i'm making it a practice, at least once a day, to go to all those five sites (all accessible, remember, from The Hunger Site) and click on each of those five links 108 times, being one mala's worth of clicks.  i've also become a Friend of each of those five sites, for $30 each, which doubles (or in the case of The Rainforest Site *triples*) the amount of money i call down from their sponsors for each click at each of those sites!  it's a wonderful way to do charitable giving, especially seeing as it costs you nothing unless you choose to become a Friend of one or more of those five sites.  it's free!  it's good!  it only costs you a click of your mouse, a *tiny* little effort!  you can help, and help genuinely and easily!  *please*, do this, for the sake of the Living Good.  *thank* you, all of you who do this to any degree at all.  one site feeds the hungry, another gives free mammograms to underprivileged women, another takes care of children's health, another preserves our rainforests, and the fifth feeds rescued animals, all of which are worthy causes in my book.  i think their idea of arranging for calling down money from their sponsors is brilliant!  but they need your mouse click or it won't work!i luv u, my reader my friend, never forget that.  accept my gift to you of the gift of giving easily.                        hey, peeps, you know what?  i really honestly deserve all that love i need.  yeah, i'm a little guy -- actually that's part of my cuteness! (see my pic.)  and i'm a very loving guy and a very good guy and a very intelligent guy and a very sincere guy and i'm very determined to set the whole world right and all that very good stuff, very.  i take good care of myself, with a good vegetarian diet and plenty of exercise and meditation for instance.  the only things that are holding me back from doing some of the things i need to do are a mysterious pain problem and lack of the wonderful beautiful (inside and out) boyfriend i so very much deserve.  the pain problem is strictly temporary, and after all it's only pain.  i can still function.  and anyway i have my will set to the 'perfect health' setting, so therefore i will be pain-free, and *soon*!!  and no *way* am i going to let it stand between my boyfriend and me, once he and i find each other, which is gonna be *soon* i vow.i luv u, my reader my friend.  {smooch}  l8rz...                        hey, peeps.it's been a long time since i've posted to this blog.  i've come out publicly since then, in may of last year.  congratulate me!  this isn't my main blog anymore, though i haven't posted there either in a long time either, until just a few minutes ago that is, but there it is.but i'll post here too.  this blog will be mostly about my life as a gay guy per se, my coming out process (i'm out publicly, but i don't think word has gotten everywhere yet for instance), my search for a boyfriend, for a life partner / husband and all that great stuff!my chronic pain situation is gradually getting better, and i'm in better spirits about my situation and have more hope about my future.  congratulate me!i'm searching, friend- and boyfriend-wise, basically on http://www.gay.com in the seattle and seattle north chat rooms, where my 'nym is ihy.  you can look for me there!  i've had some interesting chats on gay.com over the years.more l8r.  cya, dear reader, dear friend.                        hey all.  just wakin up, havin my coffee, waiting for a painkiller to take effect and contemplating my beloved treadmill.  damn!  i didn't even use the rowing machine at *all* yesterday!  shape up, david, shape up, 'cause there's no such thing as shipping out.  of course though, one day away from the rowing machine once in a long while isn't going to make your body go all to pot.  that's a matter of having an *educated* conscience.  conscience is a good thing, but only if it's healthy and educated.  otherwise it causes all sorts of hellish problems for people, doing nothing better than making them feel bad, totally uselessly.  an *educated* conscience makes you focus *not* on feeling bad, but on solving the problem in the most practical way.  *that's* the kind of conscience i want, and no other kind.  some people's 'consciences' make them feel like they have to do all sorts of really awful harmful things.  that kind of 'conscience' is really not worthy of the name, but people still call it that.  how stupid.  or rather, ignorant, to be sure, and uneducated, to be fair.  it's noone's fault really though, none of it.  we all do what we think is the best thing to do, even if we might not *think* we think it's the best, on the surface.  and we have all sorts of unrealistic ideas of what's possible, so we blame ourselves and each other for things that we never could have avoided under the circumstances, or for not doing things that we never could really have done under the circumstances -- including psychological circumstances beyond our control at the time.  we have both more and less control over things than most of us seem to realize.  it's really sad how uneducated people seem to be about the reality of their own natures.  one big thing i plan to do with my life is to teach people how things *really* are, to the extent that i know it, which frankly is more than most people seem to know about it.  i want to make people happy and at peace, and i *know* i can do it.  i want to make *you* happy and at peace, dear reader dear friend, and i vow to do my best, so please keep checking in here.  and give me *feedback*!  i didn't put an 'email david' button on the page for nothing!one thing people really need to be as happy as they can be is to be in good physical health, including being in good physical shape.  this isn't only a matter of physical well-being.  we're more or less integrated systems, spiritual, mental and physical, and keeping your body in good shape *really* does help you be in good mental and spiritual shape, all else being amenable.  and there are things almost *anyone* can do to get themselves into and keep themselves in some kind of decent physical shape, like a good well-balanced vegetarian diet, and exercise as simple as isometrics!  isometrics i can hardly recommend enough!  they *don't* take loads of time -- a full isometric workout can be done in under two minutes a day for serious benefit, especially if you do them consistently over time.  they *don't* take any specialized equipment, and no equipment at all that you're not likely to have around your place already, things like walls and doorways and beds and chairs -- so you can do them practically anywhere under a huge variety of circumstances.the isometrics book i'm working with is vic obeck's 'how to exercise without moving a muscle,' copyright 1964 by pocket books.  it's inspiring, it's got great illustrations (i think i'm in love with obeck's son steve, who appears frequently in the illustrations -- he just looks so cleancut and nice and *good*, though he's too young for me, in the pictures anyway [he must be in his mid fifties by now in real life], except for the simple friendship i really love having with young people, who respect my intelligence and my being generally such a solidly good guy) and it's short and well-written.  it's also amusing to read something that's so representative of a 50s-early 60s mentality.  i recommend it if you can still get hold of it somehow.  otherwise there must be plenty of other isometrics books out there to be had.'k, i'm out for now.  l8rz, peeps...      \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
