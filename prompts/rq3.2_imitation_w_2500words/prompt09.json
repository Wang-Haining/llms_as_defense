Of course, I am afraid he is going to take one look in my throat and tell me that I have a tumor, and that I only have about 6 more months left to live. You see, it's not only the lump that has been concerning me. I've had things going on for the past few months - things that I have ignored because I hate going to see the doctor. Now I'm just afraid I am going to find out there is something terribly wrong with me, and that it is too late to have it reversed because I waited too long to have it checked out.... *Sigh*  I need to take my mind off of this. What is a good way to do that? Oh yeah - work! I have to leave in less than an hour, and work up until 45 minutes before my appointment. I guess work is a good way to take one's mind off of something like this. At least I will get to work with my boyfriend for a couple of hours beforehand. He helps to calm  my nerves a little bit. That poor boy puts up with A LOT when it comes to being my boyfriend. And he does it without whining or complaining. He really, truly is the best thing that has ever happened to me. *kiss kiss, babe*                         For instance, like that huge lump I have discovered in the back of my throat. The one that is making swallowing diffucult. The one that could continue to grow until I suddenly can't breathe anymore. Yeah. 'SURPRISE SURPRISE,&nbsp;AMANDA,' says Life. It hands me a greeting card that says simply, 'This is most likely something serious. Good luck with that!'  I suppose I shouldn't complain. I've been fairly lucky up until now. I had a bunch of operations when I was a baby. I was born with a blockage in one of my kidneys, so I had to have most of one removed. Then after that, the only operation I had to have was back in April, when I had&nbsp; my wisdom teeth taken out. But something tells me that this could actually be more serious than the other two. What is a lump? A lump can be many things: a tumor, a cyst, a nodule...blah blah blah. Take your pick! Personally, I don't want any of them, because&nbsp;no matter&nbsp;what, it means one thing: operation. And who wants an operation done on their throat? Well, not me! In fact, the mere thought of it makes me hella nervous. Actually, the whole situation makes me nervous. I made a doctor's appointment yesterday, to have it checked out. They couldn't fit me in until next Monday. A lot can happen in a week. This lump could continue to grow until I'm gasping for breath. And then what? Go to the emergency room? What would they do for me? They could remove it, but would that be such a good idea? Nobody even knows what it is right now. Perhaps it is something that  shouldn't  be removed. Ugh. Who knows.  I shouldn't even be talking about this, but I'm having a hard time swallowing this morning, and I can feel the lump in my throat...and it's making me&nbsp; nervous. I tend to reveal too much when I'm nervous.                         And that is that people who talk a lot are annoying.  Oh, first, let me just give a little background here, for anyone who does not know me: I work in retail. A book store to be exact. We get all sorts of different people who come in the store from day to day. About 95% of them are annoying. And out of that 95%, about maybe 35% are the people who are annoying because they talk too much. Like the old man who came in today. He comes in every once in a while and buys porn magazines. Usually, he will talk to anyone and everyone about nothing...probably to direct our attention away from the fact he's buying Big Black Butt or something. Anyway, so he came in to the store twice today and talked our ears off. He was all, 'Blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah. Blah, blah blah blah!' That was the first time he came in. The second time he came in, he said, 'You know what you need to watch out for? The HIV. That is not a good thing. Liberace had a lover. He got HIV from him, and died. But before he died, he sued the guy who gave him HIV...even though he was a homo too.' And then he told me how John F. Kennedy Jr. died because his wife decided to call someone on her cell phone while they were flying in the plane. Eventually, he shut the hell up and bought porn.  Okay, so here is an update on the tetanus crisis: My jaw still hurts. And my neck hurts too. And occasionally my back. How long does it take for tetanus to kill you? And can I get tetanus, even though I don't recall having ever cut myself recently? And is there a way to cure my hypochondriac-ism? Anyone?                        I have finally written the third installment of my immensley popular 'Scary Shit' series. I hope it was worth the wait!    Scary Shit 3: Twist Ending   by Amanda   One week ago today, the beautiful, fairly large-breasted woman of Dirk Kirkland's life (Britney Smith) was brutally murdered -  stabbed visciously by an unkown Man With The Knife, soon after Britney and Dirk had passionate mind-blowing sex.  Dirk was now dating Samantha Banger - the most popular girl in school. Well...the most popular now that the  other  two most popular girls in school had been hacked to death.  'I feel so sad for Britney and Candie,' said Samantha. Candie was Man With The Knife's first victim, and also Samantha's half cousin twice-removed. 'I truly believe they are in Heaven now, looking down upon us.'   Uh oh , thought Dirk. If Britney was looking down upon them, then she probably saw him and Samantha in the shower together last night. 'Yeah,' Dirk said, clearing his throat, 'Heaven.'  'Want to go out on a date tonight?' asked Samantha. 'We could head up to Lover's Lane and make out. You can touch my boobs. Again.'  'Uh...' said Dirk nervously. 'That sounds great. But is it such a good idea for us to be roaming around after dark, with a serial killer on the loose?'  Samantha shrugged. 'Sure, why not?'  'Okay then,' Dirk said.    LATER THAT EVENING...    Dirk drove up to Lover's Lane, where he would eventually make out with Samantha and touch her boobs. He parked the car. They were the only ones up there that evening.  'I'll be right back,' said Samantha flirtaciously.  'Okay!' said Dirk excitedly. He couldn't wait to touch her boobs.  Samantha got out of the car. Dirk realized afterwards that it was very stupid to let her go out into the dark, menacing, isolated world without him, but he had complete faith that nothing bad would happen to h-  'AGHHHHH!' somebody screamed.  Dirk recognized the scream as Samantha. 'Oh noes!' he cried. Quickly, he exited the car and followed the screams. As he ran, terrible thoughts ran through his head - what if something bad happened to Samantha? He wouldn't get to make out with her. He wouldn't get to touch her boobs. Well actually, he could still touch her boobs, even if she were murdered, which was cool.  'I'm coming sweetie!!!' he yelled bravely.  Finally, he found her...on the ground...completely still. 'Oh no,' he muttered. 'You've been murdered!' He  frowned. He  paused for a moment of silence, in memory of Samantha, and then reached out to touch her boob.  But before his hand could reach her bosom, a hand shot out and grabbed his arm.  Her  hand. Samantha's hand.  'WTF?!' said Dirk in a very confused voice.  Samantha smiled up at him, and then her other arm shot out. Her hand was holding a knife.  Dirk gasped frightenedly and jumped up  and backed away from her. 'OMG! Samantha! What are you doing with that knife?'  'I'm the killer,' said Samantha.  'Oh,' said Dirk. 'But why? Why did you do it?'  'Because,' said Samantha. 'I wanted to be the most popular girl in school. Candie was the most popular girl, so I killed her. However, I had no idea that her death would mean that  Britney  would then be considered the most popular girl. So...I killed her too. Now  I'm  the most popular girl in school! Yay!'  This all made sense to Dirk. 'Okay. So then why are you going to kill  me ?'  Samantha laughed. 'Oh, I'm not going to kill you, silly. Look! This knife isn't even real! It's one of those retractable rubber knives! LOL!' She stuck the retractable rubber knife into her abdomen and laughed.  'OH! Hahahahaha!' Dirk said in relieved voice. He and Samantha started walking back towards his fancy, really expensive car. 'So...wait a second. There is still something about this whole thing that is bothering me.'  'Yes, snookums?' Samantha said, giving Dirk a peck on the cheek.  'Well...the killer was always described as a male...you know...The  Man  With The Knife. Why is that, I wonder?' Dirk looked confused.  Samantha smiled. 'Oh. That. Right. Well...you see...I used to be Samuel Banger. I got a sex change two years ago. So technically...I am a man.'  ' Ohhhh ,' Dirk said, starting to understand it all. Suddenly, he felt very sick to his stomach.   The End.                          I am only one step away from having my blog look exactly the way I want it to. The only problem? Well, I changed the font color to white, so that it could be read against this dark background. But somehow, changing it to white, also changed the text in the Comments section to white as well. And the background to Comments is still light blue. Light blue and white don't mix, people. So I cannot read the comments you post, unless I highlight them with the mouse. Argh. I just need to either change the background of the comments page, or the font color. AND I CAN'T SEEM TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO EITHER ONE!   Well anyway, enough of my complaining. So today is my very last day as a 23-year-old. Starting tomorrow, I will be the big 2-4. SCARY. I will miss being 23. It was a good combination of an even number and an odd number - not to mention it was in direct numerical order. Now I won't encounter that again until I'm 34. OMG. 34. That is practically right around the corner.  So how am I spending my last day as a 23-year-old? Why - I AM WORKING! YAY! 12:30 to 9:00. But hey, at least I get tomorrow off. As does my boyfriend. I'm sure he's planning some big surprise party for me. LOL.                        It is called  Scary Shit . Let me know what you think of it!   Scary Shit   by Amanda   It was dark out, and it was raining. A young, big-breasted woman named Candie Barr was hanging out alone by the pool in her backyard. She was very rich.  'I think I'm going to take my clothes off and skinny dip in my pool,' she said to herself. She took off her clothes and jumped into the pool. Little did she know, a man with a knife was watching her from the shadows.  'I feel like I'm being watched,' Candie said, once again talking to herself.  'That's because I'm watching you,' said Man With The Knife.  'Oh, well then that makes sense!' Candie said ditzyly. But then she realized she was talking to a man with a knife in his hand. 'Oh noes!' she screamed, covering up her enormous breasts with her arms. 'Are you going to kill me?'  'Yes,' said Man With The Knife.  'Crap!' said Candie. She got out of the pool and walked over to Man With The Knife. 'Please don't kill me!' she pleaded.  Man With The Knife ignored her, and stabbed her until she was dead.
